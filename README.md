# Visual Studio Community 2022 Project Setup

This project provides a fully prepared Visual Studio Community 2022 solution, along with a pre-configured Git repository. To get started, simply download the zipped project folder and open it in Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Community 2022 (or a compatible edition)
- Git installed on your machine

## Setup Instructions
1. **Download the Project**  
   [Click here to download the project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yRKSYezBVMyd9jjwkizQ5t_aIZQh8oxr/view?usp=share_link) from Google Drive.  
   
   *Note: Make sure to unzip the downloaded folder before proceeding.*

2. **Open the Project**  
   Open Visual Studio and select **File > Open > Project/Solution**. Navigate to the unzipped folder and open the `.sln` file to load the solution.

3. **Confirm Git Configuration**  
   Once the project is open, verify that the Git repository is already set up by checking:
   - The **Git Changes** window: it should display pending changes if any.
   - The **Remote Origin**: run `git remote -v` in the terminal (accessible via **View > Terminal**) to confirm the repository’s URL.

4. **Start Developing**  
   You’re ready to push, pull, and collaborate. Since the folder is already initialized as a Git repository and connected to a remote, you can use all standard Git commands right away.
